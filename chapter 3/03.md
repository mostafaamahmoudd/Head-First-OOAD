# Requirements Change

## Change Is Inevitable

In the real world, requirements are always changing.  
It’s your responsibility to adapt to these changes and keep the customer satisfied.

---

## The Customer Is Always Right

Even when requirements change, you must be ready to update your application and ensure it continues to work the way your customers expect.

When a customer has a new need, it’s your job to change the system to meet that need.

## The One Constant in Software Analysis and Design Is Change

**Requirements always change.**  
If you have good use cases, you can usually adjust your software quickly to handle new requirements.

---

## Use Cases Must Make Sense to You

If a use case is confusing, **rewrite it**.

There are many ways to write use cases. What matters is that:

- You understand it    
- Your team understands it    
- You can clearly explain it to others

## Paths Through a Use Case

The **main path** describes what should happen most of the time.

Most use cases include three types of paths:

1. **Main Path**  
    The most common and expected flow of events.    
2. **Alternate Path**  
    A path that occurs when something unusual happens or when there is another valid way to reach the goal.    
3. **Optional Path**  
    A path that may occur but does not replace the main path.

## Questions About Use Case Paths

**Q: I understand the main path, but what exactly is an alternate path?**  
**A:** An alternate path is one or more steps that:

- Are optional, or    
- Provide an alternate way to move through the use case    

Alternate paths can:

- Add steps to the main path, or    
- Provide a completely different way to reach the goal    

---

**Q: What if there are two different paths through part of a use case?**  
**A:** That is simply another form of an alternate path.

---

**Q: Can a single use case have multiple alternate paths?**  
**A:** Absolutely.  
A use case can have:

- Multiple alternate paths    
- Multiple ways to reach the ending condition    
- Alternate paths that even end the use case early    

---

## Scenarios

A **scenario** is a complete path through a use case, from the first step to the last.

- Most use cases have **multiple scenarios**    
- All scenarios share the **same customer goal**    
- Alternate paths may exist but are not part of the most common scenario    

---

## Updating Requirements

Any time you change a use case, you must **revisit your requirements**.

The goal of a good use case is to produce good requirements.  
If the use case changes, the requirements may need to change as well.

With new requirements comes **new code**.

---

## Hidden Design Problems

Sometimes, a change in requirements reveals problems in your system that you didn’t even know existed.

Change exposes design weaknesses—and that’s a good thing.

---

## Continuous Improvement

Change is constant.  
Your system should improve every time you work on it.

---

## Requirements Recap

- Good requirements ensure the system works as customers expect.    
- Requirements must cover **all steps in all use cases**.    
- Use cases help uncover forgotten or missing requirements.    
- Use cases reveal incomplete requirements.    
- Requirements will always change and grow over time.    

---

## Object-Oriented Principles

- **Encapsulate what varies.**    

This allows parts of the system to change without affecting everything else.

---

## Key Bullet Points

- Requirements always change as a project evolves.    
- Systems must evolve to support new requirements.    
- When behavior changes, update the **use case first**.    
- A **scenario** is a single path through a use case from start to finish.    
- A single use case can have multiple scenarios if they share the same goal.    
- Alternate paths:    
    - May occur only some of the time        
    - May provide completely different routes through the use case        
- Optional or alternate steps should be documented using numbered sub-steps (e.g., 3.1, 4.1, 2.1.1).    
- Duplicate code should be avoided; it increases maintenance cost and often indicates poor design.
