## Getting Good Requirements

How do you figure out what a customer really wants?
And how do you make sure the customer even knows what they really want?

That’s where **good requirements** come in.

### The Basic Process

1. Gather requirements for the system.
2. Figure out what the system should **really** do.
3. Get any additional information needed from the customer.
4. Build the system **right**.

---

## So What Exactly Is a Requirement?

A requirement is:

* **A specific thing**
  A requirement is usually a single, testable item. You can verify whether or not it has been fulfilled.

* **Your system**
  The “system” is the complete application or project you’re working on.

* **Has to do**
  For the system to work correctly.

> Remember: **the customer decides when a system works correctly**.
> If you leave out a requirement—or if the customer forgets to mention one—the system is not working correctly.

### Formal Definition

**Requirement:** A singular need detailing what a particular product or service should be or do.
The term is most commonly used in systems engineering and software engineering.

---

## Listen to the Customer

When it comes to requirements:

* Let the customer talk.
* Focus on **what** the system needs to do.
* Worry about **how** it will do it later.

Sometimes, even the **customer doesn’t know what they really want**.

Your job is to:

* Ask questions
* Clarify expectations
* Discover hidden needs
* Anticipate problems before they happen

---

## Questions About Requirements

**Q: So a requirement is just something the customer wants the application to do?**
**A:** Not exactly. That’s where you start, but it’s not enough.

Customers expect systems to:

* Work correctly
* Keep working even when things go wrong

Good requirements go beyond what customers explicitly say.
They **anticipate failures, edge cases, and unusual usage**, and include requirements to handle them.

---

**Q: Why do I need to think about how users will use the system? Isn’t that their problem?**
**A:** No. Remember the first rule of great software:

> Your application must work the way the customer wants it to work—even if that’s not how *you* would use it.

To do that, you must understand:

* What the system has to do
* How customers will actually use it

---

## Understanding the System’s Purpose

The best way to get good requirements is to **understand what the system is supposed to do**.

That’s where **use cases** come in.

---

## Use Cases

When you wrote down the steps for getting Fido outside to use the bathroom, you were writing a **use case**.

### What Is a Use Case?

A use case describes the **steps a system takes to make something happen**.

### Example Use Case

```text
Todd and Gina’s Dog Door, version 2.0
What the Door Does

1. Fido barks to be let out.
2. Todd or Gina hears Fido barking.
3. Todd or Gina presses the button on the remote control.
4. The dog door opens.
5. Fido goes outside.
6. Fido does his business.
   6.1 The door shuts automatically.
   6.2 Fido barks to be let back inside.
   6.3 Todd or Gina hears Fido barking again.
   6.4 Todd or Gina presses the button on the remote control.
   6.5 The dog door opens again.
7. Fido goes back inside.
8. The door shuts automatically.
```

## Key Ideas About Use Cases

* A use case describes **what** the system does, not **how** it does it.
* Focus on system behavior, not implementation details.
* A **single use case focuses on a single goal**.
* If a new goal appears, it requires a **new use case**.
* Users are **outside the system**, not part of it.
* A use case ends when the **customer goal is achieved**.
* Every use case is triggered by an **external action**.

---

## Formal Definition of a Use Case

**Use Case:**
A technique for capturing the potential requirements of a new system or software change.
Each use case provides one or more scenarios that describe how the system interacts with users or other systems to achieve a specific goal.

---

## One Use Case, Three Essential Parts

A good use case must include all three:

### 1. Clear Value

The use case must help the customer achieve a goal.
If it doesn’t provide value, it isn’t useful.

### 2. Start and Stop

* A clear starting event
* A clear condition that signals completion

### 3. External Initiator

Every use case is initiated by something **outside the system**:

* A person
* Another system
* A device or event

---

## Questions About Use Cases

**Q: Is a use case just a list of steps?**
**A:** In most cases, yes. But the key is that it focuses on **one specific goal**.

---

**Q: Does my system need a use case for every goal?**
**A:** Exactly.
One goal equals one use case.
More goals mean more use cases.

---

**Q: Why don’t use cases talk about classes like DogDoor or Remote?**
**A:** Because use cases are meant to explain **what the system does**, not how it’s built.

Use cases should:

* Use simple language
* Avoid programming jargon
* Be understandable by customers and managers

---

**Q: Is a use case the same as a use case diagram?**
**A:** No.

* Use cases describe behavior in text
* Use case diagrams show use cases visually

---

**Q: If use cases don’t help me write code, why bother?**
**A:** Use cases help you write the **right code**.

You can’t build great software if you don’t first understand what the customer wants.
Use cases bridge that gap.

---

## Planning for the Real World

Your system must work:

* In normal conditions
* When things go wrong
* In unexpected situations

Good use cases help you plan and test for failure scenarios.

---

## Warning

Good use cases lead to good requirements.
Incomplete or poorly written use cases lead to **bad requirements**.

---

## OOA&D and Requirements

Object-Oriented Analysis & Design is about writing great software.
You cannot do that unless your system does **exactly what the customer wants it to do**.

---

## Requirements Checklist

* Good requirements ensure your system behaves as customers expect.
* Requirements should cover all steps in your use cases.
* Use cases reveal missing or forgotten requirements.
* Refine and expand requirements after writing use cases.

---

## Summary Bullet Points

* Requirements define what a system must do to work correctly.
* Initial requirements usually come from the customer.
* Use cases help uncover missing requirements.
* Each use case focuses on a single goal.
* A use case may have multiple paths to reach its goal.
* Good use cases have:
  * A clear start and stop
  * An external initiator
  * Clear value to the user
* A use case is a story about how the system works.
* Real-world systems must handle failure and unexpected behavior.
* Alternate paths are essential to reaching system goals.
